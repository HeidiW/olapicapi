# olapicapi
Front end code for Olapic technical challenge. 
First, I realize this is not incredibly sophisticated. I did challenge myself to use fetch, which I have never used before. I found the Olapic API documentation to be quite accurate and helpful in my process. One of the reasons I am excited about the Solutions Architect postion is that I would very much like to spend more time coding, so, ultimately, I got a lot out of this challenge. I plan to keep working on this to add resposiveness, to experiment with CSS grid or flex, and add Instagram handle overlays on mouseover.
